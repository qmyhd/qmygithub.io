			<h2> Physics Teaching Assistant </h2>
			<hr class = "thin">
			<p> During the spring semester of 2022, I worked at UVA as a TA for general physics 1 (PHYS 1425). My duties included grading, helping explain problems in class,
			 and holding office hours. This was a rewarding experience for me, as it gave me an opportunity to strengthen my math and physics skills while helping others.
			Moreover, I had the chance to experience an active-learning version of physics, something completely new to both me and the university.
